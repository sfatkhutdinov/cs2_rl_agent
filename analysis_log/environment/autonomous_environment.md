## Context

The Autonomous Environment is a key component in the CS2 reinforcement learning agent architecture, serving as a bridge between the base CS2 environment and more advanced environment implementations like the Vision-Guided Environment and Strategic Environment. It extends the base environment with capabilities for autonomous operation, decision memory, and performance metrics tracking.

## Architecture Overview

The Autonomous Environment implementation consists of two main classes:

1. **AutonomousEnvironment**: A generic wrapper class that adds autonomous capabilities to any base environment.
2. **AutonomousCS2Environment**: A specialized implementation that extends CS2Environment with autonomous features.

### Class Hierarchy

StrategicEnvironment
```

The Autonomous Environment serves as a foundation for more specialized environments, providing core autonomous capabilities that are extended by its subclasses.

## Key Components

### 1. Decision Memory

The Autonomous Environment maintains a history of recent decisions, allowing the agent to learn from past experiences:

```python
self.use_decision_memory = self.autonomous_config.get("use_decision_memory", True)
self.decision_memory_size = self.autonomous_config.get("decision_memory_size", 10)
self.decision_memory = []
```

This memory is updated during each step and can be included in the observation space to provide the agent with context about its recent actions.

### 2. Performance Metrics

The environment tracks several performance metrics to evaluate the agent's progress:

```python
self.performance_metrics = {
    "success_rate": 0.0,
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "efficiency": 0.0,
    "learning_progress": 0.0
}
```

These metrics are updated based on rewards and episode completion, providing a high-level view of the agent's performance.

### 3. Extended Observation Space

The Autonomous Environment extends the base environment's observation space to include additional information:

```python
def extend_observation_space(self):
    # Preserve the original observation space
    self.vision_observation_space = self.observation_space
    
    # Get additional observation components
    additional_spaces = {}
    
    # Add metrics to observation if enabled
    if self.autonomous_config.get("observe_metrics", True):
        additional_spaces["metrics"] = spaces.Box(
            low=0.0, 
            high=1.0, 
            shape=(4,),  # success_rate, confidence, efficiency, learning_progress
            dtype=np.float32
        )
    
    # Add decision memory to observation if enabled
    if self.use_decision_memory:
        additional_spaces["decision_memory"] = spaces.Box(
            low=-np.inf,
            high=np.inf,
            shape=(self.decision_memory_size, 5),  # action, reward, success, confidence, time
            dtype=np.float32
        )
    
    # Create the extended observation space
    self.observation_space = spaces.Dict({
        **self.observation_space.spaces,
        **additional_spaces
    })
```

This extended observation space provides the agent with more context for decision-making.

### 4. Exploration Parameters

The Autonomous Environment includes parameters to control exploration behavior:

```python
self.exploration_frequency = exploration_frequency
self.random_action_frequency = random_action_frequency
self.menu_exploration_buffer_size = menu_exploration_buffer_size
```

These parameters allow the environment to balance exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for effective learning.

## Configuration

The Autonomous Environment is highly configurable through YAML configuration files:

### autonomous_config.yaml

```yaml
# Autonomous exploration config
autonomous:
  exploration_frequency: 0.4
  random_action_frequency: 0.2
  menu_exploration_buffer_size: 100  # Larger buffer to explore more menus
  use_decision_memory: true
  decision_memory_size: 10
  observe_metrics: true
```

This configuration allows for fine-tuning the autonomous behavior to match specific learning requirements.

## Integration with Training

The Autonomous Environment is integrated into the training process through the `train_autonomous.py` script:

```python
# Wrap with autonomous environment
autonomous_config = config.get("autonomous", {})
env = AutonomousCS2Environment(
    base_env=base_env,
    exploration_frequency=autonomous_config.get("exploration_frequency", 0.3),
    random_action_frequency=autonomous_config.get("random_action_frequency", 0.2),
    menu_exploration_buffer_size=autonomous_config.get("menu_exploration_buffer_size", 50),
    logger=logger
)
```

This integration allows for seamless training of agents in the autonomous environment.

## Interaction with Other Components

### 1. Adaptive Agent

The Autonomous Environment is one of the modes used by the Adaptive Agent, which can switch between different training modes based on performance metrics:

```python
# From test_adaptive_modes.py
agent.current_mode = TrainingMode.AUTONOMOUS
```

### 2. Vision-Guided Environment

The Vision-Guided Environment extends the Autonomous Environment, adding vision guidance capabilities:

```python
class VisionGuidedCS2Environment(AutonomousCS2Environment):
    # ...
```

### 3. Strategic Environment

The Strategic Environment wraps the Autonomous Environment, adding strategic capabilities:

```python
class StrategicEnvironment(gym.Wrapper):
    # A wrapper around the AutonomousCS2Environment that adds strategic capabilities
    # ...
```

## Key Methods

### 1. update_decision_memory

```python
def update_decision_memory(self, action_probs):
    """
    Update the decision memory with new action probabilities.
    
    Args:

    """
    if not self.use_decision_memory:
        return
    
    # Initialize decision memory if empty
    if not self.decision_memory:
        self.decision_memory = [np.zeros(self.action_space.n) for _ in range(self.decision_memory_size)]
    
    # Add new action probs and remove oldest
    self.decision_memory.pop(0)
    self.decision_memory.append(action_probs)
```

        done: Whether the episode is done
    """
    # Simple updates for the metrics, in a real system these would be more sophisticated
    alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate for metrics update
    
    # Update success rate based on reward
    if reward > 0:
        self.performance_metrics["success_rate"] += alpha * (1.0 - self.performance_metrics["success_rate"])
    else:
        self.performance_metrics["success_rate"] -= alpha * self.performance_metrics["success_rate"]
    
    # Bound success rate between 0 and 1
    self.performance_metrics["success_rate"] = max(0.0, min(1.0, self.performance_metrics["success_rate"]))
    
    # Update other metrics (simplified for demonstration)
    if done and reward > 0:
        self.performance_metrics["confidence"] += alpha
        self.performance_metrics["learning_progress"] += alpha * 0.5
    
    # Bound all metrics between 0 and 1

def get_extended_observation(self, vision_observation):
    """
    Create extended observation with additional information.
    
    Args:
        vision_observation: Base vision observation
    
    Returns:
        Extended observation
    """
    if isinstance(self.observation_space, spaces.Dict):
        # Create the extended observation dictionary
        obs = {
            "vision": vision_observation
        }
        
        # Add metrics if needed
        if "metrics" in self.observation_space.spaces:
            obs["metrics"] = np.array([
                self.performance_metrics["success_rate"],
                self.performance_metrics["confidence"],
                self.performance_metrics["efficiency"],
                self.performance_metrics["learning_progress"]
            ], dtype=np.float32)
        
        # Add decision memory if needed
        if "decision_memory" in self.observation_space.spaces and self.use_decision_memory:
            obs["decision_memory"] = np.array(self.decision_memory, dtype=np.float32)
        
        return obs
    else:
        # If no extensions, return the original vision observation
        return vision_observation
```

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **Improved Metrics Calculation**: The current implementation uses a simple update rule for performance metrics. A more sophisticated approach could provide better insights into agent performance.

2. **Dynamic Exploration**: The exploration parameters could be adjusted dynamically based on the agent's performance, allowing for more efficient learning.

3. **Enhanced Decision Memory**: The decision memory could be extended to include more context about each action, such as the state of the environment when the action was taken.

4. **Parallel Processing**: The environment could benefit from parallel processing for computationally intensive tasks, such as updating performance metrics.

## Testing

While there is no dedicated test file for the Autonomous Environment, it is indirectly tested through:

1. **test_adaptive_modes.py**: Tests the integration with the Adaptive Agent.
2. **test_cs2_env.py**: Tests the base environment that the Autonomous Environment extends.
3. **train_autonomous.py**: Provides a practical test of the environment during training.

## Conclusion
