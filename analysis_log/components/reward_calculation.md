# Reward Calculation System Analysis

## Context
This analysis examines the reward calculation system of the CS2 reinforcement learning agent. The reward function is arguably one of the most critical components of any reinforcement learning system, as it guides the agent's learning process by defining what constitutes success. In the CS2 agent, the reward calculation transforms complex game state information into structured reward signals that enable the agent to learn effective strategies over time. This document details the architecture, methodology, and implementation of the reward calculation system, as well as its impact on agent behavior and performance.

## Methodology
To analyze the reward calculation system, we:
1. Examined the reward function implementation and related components
2. Traced the data flow from game state observation to reward signals
3. Identified the different reward components and their weights
4. Analyzed how rewards are processed during training and evaluation
5. Evaluated the impact of different reward structures on agent behavior
6. Identified potential areas for optimization and enhancement

## Reward Function Architecture

The reward calculation system follows a hierarchical, multi-component architecture:

### Key Components

1. **State Observation Parser**:
   - Extracts relevant information from game state
   - Identifies player position, health, ammunition, enemies, and other environmental factors
   - Processes visual information from the vision system
   - Calculates state deltas between timesteps

2. **Primary Objective Rewards**:
   - Rewards for primary game objectives (eliminations, round wins, bomb plants/defuses)
   - High-weight, sparse rewards that represent major achievements

3. **Secondary Objective Rewards**:
   - Rewards for progress toward primary objectives (position improvement, health preservation)
   - Medium-weight, more frequent rewards that guide exploration

4. **Behavioral Shaping Rewards**:
   - Rewards for desired behaviors (ammo conservation, teamwork)
   - Low-weight, dense rewards that shape tactical behaviors

5. **Penalty Functions**:
   - Negative rewards for undesired behaviors (friendly fire, unnecessary movement)
   - Calibrated to discourage specific actions without overwhelming primary objectives

6. **Reward Aggregation System**:
   - Combines all reward components using weighted summation
   - Applies temporal discounting for multi-step actions
   - Handles credit assignment for delayed rewards

7. **Reward Normalization**:
   - Scales rewards to control gradient magnitude during training
   - Adjusts reward scale dynamically based on training progress
   - Implements reward clipping to prevent exploitation of reward extremes

## Implementation Details

### Reward Component Calculation

The reward calculation begins with parsing the game state:

```python
class StateParser:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.previous_state = None
        
    def parse_state(self, observation):
        """Extract relevant features from the game state observation."""
        parsed_state = {
            'player': self._parse_player_state(observation),
            'enemies': self._parse_enemy_states(observation),
            'team': self._parse_team_states(observation),
            'objectives': self._parse_objective_states(observation),
            'map': self._parse_map_state(observation),
            'round': self._parse_round_state(observation)
        }
        
        # Calculate deltas if previous state exists
        if self.previous_state is not None:
            parsed_state['deltas'] = self._calculate_state_deltas(
                self.previous_state, parsed_state)
        else:
            parsed_state['deltas'] = None
            
        # Update previous state
        self.previous_state = copy.deepcopy(parsed_state)
        
        return parsed_state
        
    def _parse_player_state(self, observation):
        """Extract player-specific state features."""
        return {
            'health': observation['player']['health'],
            'armor': observation['player']['armor'],
            'position': observation['player']['position'],
            'weapons': observation['player']['weapons'],
            'ammo': self._get_current_weapon_ammo(observation),
            'is_alive': observation['player']['health'] > 0
        }
        
    def _parse_enemy_states(self, observation):
        """Extract enemy-specific state features."""
        enemies = []
        for enemy in observation['entities']:
            if enemy['team'] != observation['player']['team']:
                enemies.append({
                    'id': enemy['id'],
                    'health': enemy.get('health', 100),  # Default if not visible
                    'position': enemy.get('position', None),
                    'visible': 'position' in enemy,
                    'last_seen': enemy.get('last_seen', 0)
                })
        return enemies
    
    # Other parsing methods omitted for brevity
    
    def _calculate_state_deltas(self, previous, current):
        """Calculate changes between states."""
        deltas = {
            'health_delta': current['player']['health'] - previous['player']['health'],
            'position_delta': self._calculate_position_change(
                previous['player']['position'], 
                current['player']['position']
            ),
            'enemy_visible_delta': self._count_newly_visible_enemies(
                previous['enemies'], 
                current['enemies']
            ),
            'ammo_delta': current['player']['ammo'] - previous['player']['ammo'],
            'objective_progress': self._calculate_objective_progress(
                previous['objectives'], 
                current['objectives']
            )
        }
        return deltas
```

The reward calculator combines multiple reward components:

```python
class RewardCalculator:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.reward_weights = config.get('reward_weights', {

        # Combine all components
        total_reward = primary_sum + secondary_sum + penalty_sum
        
        return total_reward
```

### Reward Normalization

The reward normalization component stabilizes training:

```python
class RewardNormalizer:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.use_running_normalization = config.get(
            'reward.use_running_normalization', False)
        self.clip_rewards = config.get('reward.clip_rewards', True)
        self.reward_clip_value = config.get('reward.clip_value', 10.0)
        
        # Running statistics for normalization
        self.reward_mean = 0.0
        self.reward_std = 1.0
        self.reward_count = 0
        self.alpha = 0.001  # Update rate for running statistics
        
    def normalize_reward(self, reward):
        """Normalize the reward to stabilize training."""
        # Update running statistics
        if self.use_running_normalization:
            self._update_statistics(reward)
            
            # Normalize using running statistics (avoid division by zero)
            if self.reward_std > 1e-8:
                normalized_reward = (reward - self.reward_mean) / self.reward_std
            else:
                normalized_reward = reward - self.reward_mean
        else:
            normalized_reward = reward
            
        # Apply reward clipping if enabled
        if self.clip_rewards:
            normalized_reward = max(
                min(normalized_reward, self.reward_clip_value), 
                -self.reward_clip_value
            )
            
        return normalized_reward
        
    def _update_statistics(self, reward):
        """Update running mean and standard deviation of rewards."""
        self.reward_count += 1
        
        # Use Welford's online algorithm for numerical stability
        delta = reward - self.reward_mean
        self.reward_mean += delta / self.reward_count
        delta2 = reward - self.reward_mean
        self.reward_std = (1 - 1/self.reward_count) * self.reward_std + delta * delta2 / self.reward_count
        
        # Take square root of variance to get standard deviation
        self.reward_std = max(math.sqrt(self.reward_std), 1e-8)
```

### Integration with the RL Agent

The reward calculation system is integrated with the agent's training loop:

```python
class RLTrainer:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.agent = self._create_agent()
        self.reward_calculator = RewardCalculator(config)
        
    def _create_agent(self):
        """Create and initialize the RL agent."""
        # Implementation depends on the specific RL algorithm
        pass
        
    def train_step(self, observation, action, next_observation, done):
        """Perform a single training step."""
        # Calculate reward for the current transition
        reward = self.reward_calculator.calculate_reward(
            observation, action, next_observation)
            
        # Add experience to agent's replay buffer
        self.agent.add_experience(observation, action, reward, next_observation, done)
        
        # Update agent if it's time
        if self.agent.is_update_time():
            self.agent.update()
            
        return reward
```

## Reward Function Design Principles

The reward function follows several key design principles:

### 1. Hierarchical Structure

Rewards are organized hierarchically, with primary game objectives carrying the highest weight, followed by secondary objectives and behavioral shaping rewards. This structure ensures that the agent prioritizes winning the game while still developing nuanced behaviors.

```python
def _design_reward_weights(self):
    """Create a hierarchical structure of reward weights."""
    return {
        # Primary objectives (highest weight)
        'elimination': 10.0,
        'winning_round': 5.0,
        'bomb_plant': 3.0,
        'bomb_defuse': 3.0,
        
        # Secondary objectives (medium weight)
        'damage_dealt': 0.1,
        'position_improvement': 0.05,
        
        # Behavioral shaping (low weight)
        'staying_alive': 0.01,
        'ammo_conservation': 0.02,
        
        # Penalties
        'friendly_fire': -2.0,
        'taking_damage': -0.1,
        'death': -1.0
    }
```

### 2. Temporal Credit Assignment

The reward system handles credit assignment for actions that have delayed effects:

```python
def _assign_delayed_credit(self, action_history, reward, decay_factor=0.9):
    """Distribute reward to previous actions that contributed to it."""
    credited_rewards = []
    
    # Apply temporal decay to distribute reward across previous actions
    for i in range(len(action_history)):
        # More recent actions get more credit
        time_index = len(action_history) - i - 1
        credit = reward * (decay_factor ** time_index)
        credited_rewards.insert(0, credit)
        
    return credited_rewards
```

### 3. Counterfactual Reasoning

For complex scenarios, the reward system employs counterfactual reasoning to evaluate the quality of decisions:

```python
def _calculate_counterfactual_reward(self, state, action, next_state):
    """Evaluate action quality through counterfactual comparison."""
    # Calculate actual outcome
    actual_outcome = self._evaluate_outcome(state, next_state)
    
    # Simulate alternative actions
    alternative_outcomes = []
    for alt_action in self._get_feasible_alternative_actions(state, action):
        simulated_next_state = self._simulate_action(state, alt_action)
        outcome = self._evaluate_outcome(state, simulated_next_state)
        alternative_outcomes.append(outcome)
        
    # Calculate reward based on actual vs. alternative outcomes
    if not alternative_outcomes:
        return 0.0
        
    avg_alternative = sum(alternative_outcomes) / len(alternative_outcomes)
    counterfactual_advantage = actual_outcome - avg_alternative
    
    return counterfactual_advantage
```

### 4. Curriculum-Based Reward Adjustment

The reward system implements a curriculum that adjusts reward weights as training progresses:

```python
class CurriculumRewardAdjuster:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.base_weights = config.get('reward.base_weights', {})
        self.current_weights = copy.deepcopy(self.base_weights)
        self.curriculum_stages = config.get('reward.curriculum_stages', [])
        self.current_stage = 0
        self.training_step = 0
        
    def update(self, training_step):
        """Update reward weights based on training progress."""
        self.training_step = training_step
        
        # Check if it's time to move to the next curriculum stage
        if (self.current_stage < len(self.curriculum_stages) and
            training_step >= self.curriculum_stages[self.current_stage]['step']):
            # Update current weights according to the stage configuration
            stage_config = self.curriculum_stages[self.current_stage]
            for reward_key, adjustment in stage_config['adjustments'].items():
                if reward_key in self.current_weights:
                    self.current_weights[reward_key] = adjustment
                    
            # Move to the next stage
            self.current_stage += 1
            
        return self.current_weights
```

## Reward Shaping Techniques

The reward calculation system employs several reward shaping techniques to guide the learning process:

### 1. Potential-Based Reward Shaping

Potential-based shaping provides additional guidance without changing the optimal policy:

```python
def _calculate_potential_based_reward(self, state, next_state):
    """Apply potential-based reward shaping."""
    # Define potential function (measures how "good" a state is)
    current_potential = self._state_potential(state)
    next_potential = self._state_potential(next_state)
    
    # Calculate shaping reward (gamma * Φ(s') - Φ(s))
    gamma = self.config.get('rl.discount_factor', 0.99)
    shaping_reward = gamma * next_potential - current_potential
    
    return shaping_reward
    
def _state_potential(self, state):
    """Calculate potential of a state."""
    # Potential based on tactical position quality
    position_potential = self._evaluate_position_quality(state['player']['position'])
    
    # Potential based on health and resources
    health_potential = state['player']['health'] / 100.0
    armor_potential = state['player']['armor'] / 100.0
    
    # Potential based on threat assessment
    threat_potential = self._evaluate_threat_level(state)
    
    # Combine potentials
    potential = (
        0.4 * position_potential +
        0.3 * health_potential +
        0.1 * armor_potential -
        0.2 * threat_potential
    )
    
    return potential
```

### 2. Curiosity-Driven Exploration

Intrinsic rewards encourage exploration of novel states:

```python
class CuriosityReward:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.feature_dim = config.get('curiosity.feature_dim', 128)
        self.learning_rate = config.get('curiosity.learning_rate', 0.001)
        
        # Create state prediction model
        self.dynamics_model = self._create_dynamics_model()
        self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
            self.dynamics_model.parameters(), 
            lr=self.learning_rate
        )
        
    def _create_dynamics_model(self):
        """Create a dynamics model to predict next state features."""
        model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.feature_dim + self.action_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, self.feature_dim)
        )
        return model
        
    def calculate_curiosity_reward(self, state_features, action, next_state_features):
        """Calculate intrinsic reward based on prediction error."""
        # Convert to tensors
        state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state_features)
        action_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(action)
        next_state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(next_state_features)
        
        # Concatenate state and action
        state_action = torch.cat([state_tensor, action_tensor], dim=0)
        
        # Predict next state
        predicted_next_state = self.dynamics_model(state_action)
        
        # Calculate prediction error (using mean squared error)
        prediction_error = F.mse_loss(
            predicted_next_state, 
            next_state_tensor, 
            reduction='sum'
        )
        
        # Use prediction error as intrinsic reward
        intrinsic_reward = self.config.get('curiosity.reward_scale', 0.01) * prediction_error.item()
        
        # Update dynamics model
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        prediction_error.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return intrinsic_reward
```

### 3. Hindsight Experience Replay

For sparse reward scenarios, the system reinterprets failed episodes as successful ones with different goals:

```python
class HindsightRewardGenerator:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        
    def generate_hindsight_experiences(self, trajectory, original_goal):
        """Generate additional experiences by reinterpreting goals."""
        hindsight_experiences = []
        
        # Use final state as an achieved goal
        achieved_goal = self._extract_achieved_goal(trajectory[-1][3])  # next_obs of last transition
        
        # Create new experiences with the achieved goal replacing the original goal
        for state, action, reward, next_state, done in trajectory:
            # Replace goals in observations
            hindsight_state = self._replace_goal(state, original_goal, achieved_goal)
            hindsight_next_state = self._replace_goal(next_state, original_goal, achieved_goal)
            
            # Recalculate reward as if achieved goal was the intended goal
            hindsight_reward = self._calculate_goal_reward(hindsight_next_state, achieved_goal)
            
            # Mark as done if goal is achieved
            hindsight_done = self._is_goal_achieved(hindsight_next_state, achieved_goal)
            
            # Add to hindsight experiences
            hindsight_experiences.append((
                hindsight_state, 
                action, 
                hindsight_reward, 
                hindsight_next_state, 
                hindsight_done
            ))
            
        return hindsight_experiences
```

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Adaptive Reward Scaling

The current fixed reward weights could be replaced with an adaptive system that adjusts based on agent performance:

```python
class AdaptiveRewardScaler:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.base_weights = config.get('reward.base_weights', {})
        self.current_weights = copy.deepcopy(self.base_weights)
        self.performance_history = []
        self.adaptation_interval = config.get('reward.adaptation_interval', 1000)
        self.max_adjustment_rate = config.get('reward.max_adjustment_rate', 0.2)
        
    def update_weights(self, episode_metrics):
        """Update reward weights based on agent performance."""
        # Add current performance to history
        self.performance_history.append(episode_metrics)
        
        # Only keep recent history
        if len(self.performance_history) > self.adaptation_interval:
            self.performance_history.pop(0)
            
        # Check if it's time to adapt
        if len(self.performance_history) == self.adaptation_interval:
            self._adapt_weights()
            
        return self.current_weights
        
    def _adapt_weights(self):
        """Adapt weights based on performance trends."""
        # Analyze performance to identify underperforming aspects
        performance_analysis = self._analyze_performance()
        
        # Adjust weights for underperforming aspects
        for aspect, adjustment in performance_analysis.items():
            if aspect in self.current_weights:
                # Limit adjustment rate
                max_change = self.base_weights[aspect] * self.max_adjustment_rate
                clamped_adjustment = max(min(adjustment, max_change), -max_change)
                
                # Apply adjustment
                self.current_weights[aspect] += clamped_adjustment
```

### 2. Contextual Reward System

A more advanced system could adjust rewards based on game context:

```python
class ContextualRewardSystem:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.base_weights = config.get('reward.base_weights', {})
        self.context_adapters = {
            'eco_round': {
                'elimination': 1.2,  # Higher value for eliminations in eco rounds
                'damage_dealt': 1.5,  # More emphasis on damage
                'staying_alive': 1.3  # Higher value for survival
            },
            'weapon_advantage': {
                'elimination': 0.9,  # Slightly lower as expected to win
                'position_improvement': 1.2  # More emphasis on positioning
            },
            'post_plant': {
                'elimination': 1.3,  # Higher value for eliminations
                'staying_alive': 1.5,  # Much higher value for survival
                'positional_improvement': 0.8  # Lower emphasis on movement
            }
        }
        
    def get_contextual_weights(self, game_state):
        """Get reward weights adapted to the current game context."""
        # Detect current context
        context = self._detect_context(game_state)
        
        # Start with base weights
        contextual_weights = copy.deepcopy(self.base_weights)
        
        # Apply context-specific adaptations
        if context in self.context_adapters:
            adapter = self.context_adapters[context]
            for key, multiplier in adapter.items():
                if key in contextual_weights:
                    contextual_weights[key] *= multiplier
                    
        return contextual_weights
        
    def _detect_context(self, game_state):
        """Detect the current game context."""
        # Implementation to determine current context
        # (eco round, weapon advantage, post-plant, etc.)
        pass
```

### 3. Hierarchical Reward Decomposition

Breaking down complex rewards into hierarchical components:

```python
class HierarchicalRewardDecomposer:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        
    def decompose_reward(self, state, action, next_state):
        """Decompose complex reward into hierarchical components."""
        # Level 1: Strategic rewards (round objectives)
        strategic_reward = self._calculate_strategic_reward(state, next_state)
        
        # Level 2: Tactical rewards (positioning, resource management)
        tactical_reward = self._calculate_tactical_reward(state, action, next_state)
        
        # Level 3: Operational rewards (aiming, movement execution)
        operational_reward = self._calculate_operational_reward(state, action, next_state)
        
        # Combine rewards with appropriate scaling
        combined_reward = (
            strategic_reward +
            0.5 * tactical_reward +
            0.2 * operational_reward
        )
        
        return {
            'total': combined_reward,
            'strategic': strategic_reward,
            'tactical': tactical_reward,
            'operational': operational_reward
        }
```

## Recommendations for Improvement

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following improvements to the reward calculation system:

1. **Implement Contextual Reward Adaptation**: Develop a context-aware reward system that adjusts weights based on the current game state and round phase.

2. **Add Counterfactual Reward Estimation**: Introduce counterfactual reasoning to evaluate the quality of decisions more accurately.

3. **Integrate Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: Add intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration of novel states, particularly in the early stages of training.

4. **Develop a Dynamic Curriculum**: Create a more sophisticated curriculum that adjusts based on the agent's learning progress rather than fixed training steps.

5. **Implement Reward Decomposition**: Break down rewards into hierarchical components to improve credit assignment and facilitate hierarchical reinforcement learning.

6. **Performance-Adaptive Reward Scaling**: Develop an adaptive system that automatically adjusts reward weights based on the agent's performance metrics.

7. **Enhanced Reward Visualization**: Create better tools for visualizing reward signals during training to identify potential reward function issues.
