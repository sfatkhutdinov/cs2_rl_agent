# Adaptive Agent System Analysis

## Context
This document examines the Adaptive Agent implementation, which represents the most sophisticated agent architecture in the system, capable of dynamically switching between different agent modes based on performance and context.

## Methodology
1. Analyzed the `adaptive_agent.py` implementation to understand its architecture
2. Examined how it integrates different agent types (Discovery, Tutorial, Vision, Autonomous, Strategic)
3. Studied the mode-switching mechanism and decision criteria
4. Investigated knowledge transfer between agent modes

## Adaptive Agent Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy
The Adaptive Agent represents a meta-agent approach that combines the strengths of different specialized agents:

```python
class AdaptiveAgent:
    """
    Meta-agent that dynamically switches between different agent modes based on
    performance metrics and environmental context.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, environment: gym.Env, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.environment = environment
        self.config = config
        self.current_mode = None
        self.agent_registry = {}
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()
        self.knowledge_base = SharedKnowledgeBase()
        
        # Initialize available agent modes
        self._initialize_agent_modes()
        
        # Set initial mode based on configuration or default progression
        self._set_initial_mode()
```

### Agent Mode Registry
The system maintains a registry of available agent modes, each specialized for different aspects of gameplay:

1. **Discovery Agent**: Specialized in UI exploration and element discovery
2. **Tutorial Agent**: Optimized for following instructions and basic interactions
3. **Vision Agent**: Focused on visual understanding and perception
4. **Autonomous Agent**: Capable of independent gameplay with minimal guidance
5. **Strategic Agent**: Advanced agent focused on long-term planning and strategy

Each agent is initialized with:
- Shared configuration with mode-specific overrides
- Access to the shared knowledge base
- Custom environment wrappers as needed
- Specialized policy networks

### Mode-Switching Mechanism
The adaptive agent implements sophisticated criteria for switching between modes:

```python
def _evaluate_mode_switch(self, observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info):
    """
    Evaluates whether to switch agent modes based on current performance and context.
    
    Returns:
        bool: Whether a mode switch was performed
    """
    # Extract performance metrics
    current_metrics = self.performance_tracker.get_recent_metrics()
    
    # Check for specific triggers in the environment
    context_triggers = self._detect_context_triggers(observation, info)
    
    # Performance-based switching criteria
    if self._should_switch_based_on_performance(current_metrics):
        target_mode = self._select_target_mode(current_metrics)
        self._switch_to_mode(target_mode)
        return True
        
    # Context-based switching criteria
    if context_triggers and self._should_switch_based_on_context(context_triggers):
        target_mode = self._select_target_mode_for_context(context_triggers)
        self._switch_to_mode(target_mode)
        return True
        
    return False
```

The mode-switching decisions are based on:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Recent reward trends (improvement/degradation)
   - Action success rates
   - Exploration efficiency
   - Learning progress indicators
   - Stagnation detection

2. **Contextual Triggers**:
   - Detection of tutorials or guided sections
   - Complex strategic scenarios
   - Exploration opportunities
   - UI navigation challenges
   - Error recovery situations

### Knowledge Sharing and Transfer

The Adaptive Agent implements a sophisticated knowledge sharing system through the `SharedKnowledgeBase`:

```python
class SharedKnowledgeBase:
    """
    Centralized knowledge repository shared across all agent modes.
    Enables transfer learning and knowledge persistence across mode switches.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.ui_elements = {}  # Discovered UI elements and their functions
        self.action_effects = {}  # Observed effects of actions in different contexts
        self.reward_components = {}  # Identified components contributing to reward
        self.exploration_map = {}  # Map of explored game areas/interfaces
        self.strategic_insights = {}  # Discovered game mechanics and strategies
        
    def update_from_experience(self, observation, action, reward, next_observation, info):
        """Update knowledge base from a single experience tuple."""
        self._update_ui_knowledge(observation, action, next_observation)
        self._update_action_effects(action, next_observation, reward, info)
        self._update_reward_understanding(observation, action, reward, info)
        self._update_exploration_map(observation, next_observation)
        self._update_strategic_insights(observation, action, reward, next_observation, info)
        
    def transfer_knowledge_to_policy(self, policy_network, agent_mode):
        """Transfer relevant knowledge to a policy network based on agent mode."""
        # Implementation depends on policy architecture
        # Could involve feature biasing, attention mechanisms, or direct parameter updates
```

Knowledge transfer occurs in several ways:
1. **Shared Representations**: Common feature extractors across modes
2. **Policy Initialization**: New modes initialize from related existing policies
3. **Experience Replay**: Valuable experiences are stored and shared
4. **Attention Guidance**: Known UI elements and game features get prioritized attention

### Performance Tracking System

The `PerformanceTracker` component monitors agent performance across different modes:

```python
class PerformanceTracker:
    """
    Tracks agent performance across modes and provides metrics for mode-switching decisions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, window_size=100):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.metrics_history = {
            'rewards': deque(maxlen=window_size),
            'action_success': deque(maxlen=window_size),
            'exploration_rate': deque(maxlen=window_size),
            'learning_progress': deque(maxlen=window_size),
            'mode_history': deque(maxlen=window_size*2),  # Track mode changes
        }
        self.mode_performance = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list))
        
    def update(self, mode, reward, action_success, exploration_rate, learning_progress):
        """Update performance metrics for the current mode."""
        self.metrics_history['rewards'].append(reward)
        self.metrics_history['action_success'].append(action_success)
        self.metrics_history['exploration_rate'].append(exploration_rate)
        self.metrics_history['learning_progress'].append(learning_progress)
        self.metrics_history['mode_history'].append(mode)
        
        # Update mode-specific metrics
        self.mode_performance[mode]['rewards'].append(reward)
        self.mode_performance[mode]['action_success'].append(action_success)
        self.mode_performance[mode]['exploration_rate'].append(exploration_rate)
        self.mode_performance[mode]['learning_progress'].append(learning_progress)
        
    def get_recent_metrics(self):
        """Get average metrics over recent window."""
        return {
            'reward_avg': np.mean(self.metrics_history['rewards']) if self.metrics_history['rewards'] else 0,
            'reward_trend': self._calculate_trend(self.metrics_history['rewards']),
            'action_success_rate': np.mean(self.metrics_history['action_success']) if self.metrics_history['action_success'] else 0,
            'exploration_efficiency': np.mean(self.metrics_history['exploration_rate']) if self.metrics_history['exploration_rate'] else 0,
            'learning_progress_rate': np.mean(self.metrics_history['learning_progress']) if self.metrics_history['learning_progress'] else 0,
            'mode_stability': self._calculate_mode_stability(),
        }
        
    def get_mode_comparison(self):
        """Compare performance across different modes."""
        comparison = {}
        for mode, metrics in self.mode_performance.items():
            if metrics['rewards']:
                comparison[mode] = {
                    'reward_avg': np.mean(metrics['rewards']),
                    'action_success_rate': np.mean(metrics['action_success']) if metrics['action_success'] else 0,
                    'sample_count': len(metrics['rewards']),
                }
        return comparison
```

This system enables data-driven decisions about mode switching by tracking:
- Performance trends within each mode
- Comparative performance across modes
- Mode stability and switching frequency
- Learning progress indicators

## Training Process

### Curriculum-Based Progression
The Adaptive Agent implements a curriculum-based training approach:

```python
def train(self, total_timesteps: int, callback=None):
    """
    Train the adaptive agent using a curriculum-based approach.
    
    Automatically switches between agent modes based on performance 
    and progresses through increasingly complex challenges.
    """
    timesteps_per_evaluation = self.config.get('adaptive', {}).get('evaluation_frequency', 10000)
    
    # Create progress tracking callback
    progress_callback = AdaptiveProgressCallback(
        eval_freq=timesteps_per_evaluation,
        performance_tracker=self.performance_tracker,
        knowledge_base=self.knowledge_base,
        log_dir=self.log_dir
    )
    
    # Combine with user-provided callback if any
    callback_list = CallbackList([progress_callback])
    if callback:
        callback_list.append(callback)
    
    completed_timesteps = 0
    while completed_timesteps < total_timesteps:
        # Run current agent mode for a segment
        segment_length = min(timesteps_per_evaluation, total_timesteps - completed_timesteps)
        
        # Get current agent from registry
        current_agent = self.agent_registry[self.current_mode]
        
        # Train for one segment
        current_agent.train(segment_length, callback=callback_list)
        completed_timesteps += segment_length
        
        # Evaluate performance and potentially switch modes
        self._periodic_mode_evaluation()
        
        # Update knowledge base from current agent's experience
        self._update_shared_knowledge()
        
    # Final evaluation and model saving
    self._final_evaluation()
    self._save_all_agent_models()
```

This approach allows the agent to:
1. Start with basic discovery and interaction
2. Progress to following tutorials and guided learning
3. Develop visual understanding of the game
4. Achieve autonomous play with basic strategy
5. Eventually master complex strategic gameplay

### Config-Driven Customization
The Adaptive Agent behavior is highly configurable:

```yaml
adaptive:
  # Mode selection and progression
  initial_mode: "discovery"  # Start with discovery agent
  auto_progression: true     # Automatically progress through modes
  
  # Mode switching parameters
  min_mode_duration: 50000   # Minimum timesteps before considering a switch
  performance_threshold: 0.75  # Performance level to trigger progression
  regression_threshold: 0.5    # Performance drop to trigger regression
  
  # Knowledge sharing settings
  knowledge_transfer: true   # Enable knowledge transfer between modes
  shared_feature_extractor: true  # Use common features across agents
  experience_replay_sharing: true  # Share experience replay buffer
  
  # Evaluation settings
  evaluation_frequency: 10000  # How often to evaluate for mode switching
  eval_episodes: 5             # Episodes per evaluation
```

This configuration-driven approach allows for easy experimentation with different adaptive strategies and hyperparameters.

## Integration with Environment System

### Environment Wrappers
Each agent mode uses specialized environment wrappers that adapt the observation and reward spaces:

```python
def _create_environment_for_mode(self, mode):
    """Create an appropriate environment wrapper for the specified agent mode."""
    base_env = self.environment
    
    if mode == "discovery":
        return DiscoveryEnvironment(base_env, self.config)
    elif mode == "tutorial":
        return TutorialEnvironment(base_env, self.config)
    elif mode == "vision":
        return VisionEnvironment(base_env, self.config)
    elif mode == "autonomous":
        return AutonomousEnvironment(base_env, self.config)
    elif mode == "strategic":
        return StrategicEnvironment(base_env, self.config)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown agent mode: {mode}")
```

These wrappers customize:
- Observation space complexity appropriate for the agent's capabilities
- Reward functions tailored to the mode's learning objectives
- Action space restrictions based on the mode's expected capabilities
- Additional information to guide learning in each phase

### Mode-Specific Callbacks
The system implements specialized callbacks for each mode:

```python
class AdaptiveProgressCallback(BaseCallback):
    """
    Tracks progress during adaptive agent training and manages mode transitions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, eval_freq, performance_tracker, knowledge_base, log_dir, verbose=0):
        super().__init__(verbose)
        self.eval_freq = eval_freq
        self.performance_tracker = performance_tracker
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base
        self.log_dir = log_dir
        self.evaluations_results = []
        self.evaluations_timesteps = []
        self.current_mode = None
        
    def _on_training_start(self):
        """Called at the start of training."""
        self.current_mode = self.model.current_mode
        
    def _on_step(self):
        """Called after each step."""
        if self.n_calls % self.eval_freq == 0:
            # Perform evaluation to assess performance
            mean_reward, std_reward = self._evaluate_agent()
            
            # Update evaluation metrics
            self.evaluations_results.append(mean_reward)
            self.evaluations_timesteps.append(self.n_calls)
            
            # Log results
            self._log_evaluation_results(mean_reward, std_reward)
            
            # Check if mode has changed
            if self.model.current_mode != self.current_mode:
                self._on_mode_switch(self.current_mode, self.model.current_mode)
                self.current_mode = self.model.current_mode
                
        return True
```
