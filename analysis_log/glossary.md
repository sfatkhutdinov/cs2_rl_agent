# Glossary of Key Terms

**Tags:** #reference #summary

## Overview
This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the CS2 reinforcement learning agent codebase analysis. It serves as a reference for understanding specialized terminology.

## Agent Concepts

### Adaptive Agent
A specialized agent implementation that dynamically switches between different operational modes based on game context and objectives. It adapts its behavior based on current conditions.

### Strategic Agent
An advanced agent capable of long-term planning, causal reasoning, and goal inference. It employs sophisticated decision-making algorithms for higher-level strategy.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
A machine learning approach where an agent learns optimal behavior through interactions with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

### Reward Mechanism
The system component that calculates and assigns rewards to the agent based on game state and agent actions, guiding the learning process.

## Vision System

### Autonomous Vision Interface
The component responsible for translating raw game visual data into structured observations using computer vision techniques.

### Ollama Vision Interface
A specialized vision component that uses machine learning models for higher-level game understanding and context recognition.

### Feature Extraction
The process of identifying and isolating relevant information from raw game observations for use in decision-making.

## Action System

### Action Space
The complete set of possible actions available to the agent within the game environment.

### Action Mapper
The component that translates high-level strategic decisions into specific game-compatible commands.

### Action Processor
The system that executes mapped actions, handling timing, sequencing, and feedback.

## System Architecture

### Bridge Mod
A modification to the game that facilitates communication between the agent and the game environment.

### Component Integration
The architecture and patterns that enable different system components to work together cohesively.

### Parallel Processing Pipeline
A system design pattern that enables concurrent processing of vision and decision tasks to improve throughput.

## Performance Concepts

### API Bottleneck
Performance limitation caused by communication delays between the vision system and external APIs.

### Latency
The time delay between initiating a process (e.g., action selection) and its completion.

### Throughput
The rate at which the system can process observations and generate actions.

## Testing and Deployment

### Integration Testing
Testing focused on verifying that different components work correctly together.

### Simulation Environment
A controlled testing environment that simulates game conditions without requiring the actual game to run.

### CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment process that automates testing and deployment of the agent.

### Canary Deployment
A deployment strategy where changes are gradually rolled out to a subset of environments before full deployment.

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
The ability of a system to continue functioning, albeit with reduced capabilities, when parts of it fail.

### Error Recovery Mechanism
Systems and processes designed to detect, respond to, and recover from failures.

### Resilience
A system's ability to maintain acceptable performance under adverse conditions or when components fail.
