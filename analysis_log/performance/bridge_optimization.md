## Overview

This document outlines the optimizations implemented for the CS2 RL Agent's bridge communication protocol. These improvements focus on enhancing performance, reliability, and maintainability of the communication between the agent and the game environment.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. API Interface Enhancements

#### 1.1 Batched API Requests

The API interface now supports batching multiple actions into a single request, significantly reducing the overhead of multiple HTTP requests.

```python
# Before optimization:
# Each action required a separate HTTP request
for action in actions:
    api.perform_action(action)

# After optimization:
# Actions are batched and sent in a single request when the batch size is reached
for action in actions:
    api.perform_action(action)  # Automatically batches
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced network overhead
- Lower latency for action execution
- Decreased server load

#### 1.2 Connection Pooling

Implemented connection pooling to reuse HTTP connections rather than establishing new connections for each request.

```python
# Connection pooling implementation
def _create_session_with_retries(self):
    session = requests.Session()
    if self.use_connection_pooling:
        adapter = HTTPAdapter(
            pool_connections=10,
            pool_maxsize=100,
            max_retries=Retry(
                total=self.retry_attempts,
                backoff_factor=self.retry_backoff_factor,
                status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
            )
        )
        session.mount('http://', adapter)
        session.mount('https://', adapter)
    return session
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster request processing
- Reduced TCP handshake overhead
- Better resource utilization

#### 1.3 Binary Serialization for Images

Implemented binary serialization for image data to reduce bandwidth usage and improve transfer speeds.

```python
# Binary serialization for image data
if self.use_binary_serialization:
    # Send binary image data directly
    response = self.session.get(
        f"{self.base_url}/observation",
        timeout=self.timeout
    )
    # Process binary response
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
    return np.array(image)
else:
    # Use JSON with base64 encoding (legacy approach)
    response = self.session.get(
        f"{self.base_url}/observation",
        timeout=self.timeout
    )
    data = response.json()
    # Decode base64 image
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Faster image transfer
- Lower CPU usage for serialization/deserialization

### 2. Configuration Validation Schema

Implemented a JSON Schema-based validation system for configuration files to ensure consistency and prevent runtime errors.

```python
# Example of schema validation
def validate_config(config):
    """Validate a configuration dictionary against the schema."""
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=config, schema=CONFIG_SCHEMA)
        return []
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        return [str(e)]
```

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of configuration errors
- Clear error messages for misconfiguration
- Self-documenting configuration requirements

### 3. Parallel Vision Processing Enhancements

#### 3.1 Optimized Caching Mechanism

Implemented a sophisticated caching system for vision processing results to avoid redundant processing of similar frames.

```python
class VisionCache:
    """Cache for vision processing results."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_size=100):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.size = 0
        self.hits = 0
        self.misses = 0
        self.evictions = 0
    
    def generate_key(self, image, task_type, params):
        """Generate a cache key from the image, task type, and parameters."""
        # Hash the image data and parameters to create a unique key
        image_hash = hashlib.md5(image.tobytes()).hexdigest()
        params_hash = hashlib.md5(json.dumps(params, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()
        return f"{task_type}_{image_hash}_{params_hash}"
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced redundant processing
- Lower CPU usage
- Faster response times for repeated tasks

#### 3.2 Adaptive Worker Thread Allocation

Implemented dynamic adjustment of worker threads based on system load and queue depth.

```python
def _adaptive_worker_manager(self):
    """Periodically adjust the number of workers based on system load."""
    while self.running:
        try:
            # Get current CPU usage and queue depth
            cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1.0)
            queue_depth = self.task_queue.qsize()
            
            # Adjust workers based on load
            if cpu_usage > self.cpu_threshold and self.num_workers > self.min_workers:
                # Reduce workers if CPU usage is high
                self._adjust_workers(self.num_workers - 1)
                logging.info(f"Reduced workers to {self.num_workers} due to high CPU usage ({cpu_usage}%)")
            elif queue_depth > self.queue_size * 0.8 and self.num_workers < self.max_workers:
                # Increase workers if queue is filling up
                self._adjust_workers(self.num_workers + 1)
                logging.info(f"Increased workers to {self.num_workers} due to high queue depth ({queue_depth})")
            
            time.sleep(5.0)  # Check every 5 seconds
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error in adaptive worker manager: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**
- Optimal resource utilization
- Automatic scaling based on workload
- Prevention of system overload

#### 3.3 Task Prioritization

Implemented a priority queue system for vision processing tasks to ensure critical tasks are processed first.

```python
class VisionTask:
    """Represents a vision processing task with priority."""
    
    def __init__(self, image, task_type, params, callback=None, priority=0, roi=None):
        self.image = image
        self.task_type = task_type
        self.params = params
        self.callback = callback
        self.priority = priority  # Lower number = higher priority
        self.roi = roi
        self.task_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.timestamp = time.time()
    
    def __lt__(self, other):
        """Compare tasks for priority queue ordering."""
        return self.priority < other.priority
```

**Benefits:**
- Critical tasks processed first
- Improved responsiveness for high-priority operations
- Better control over processing order

### 4. Error Resilience and Recovery

#### 4.1 Sophisticated Retry Logic

Implemented advanced retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient failures.

```python
# Retry configuration in session creation
max_retries = Retry(
    total=self.retry_attempts,
    backoff_factor=self.retry_backoff_factor,
    status_forcelist=[500, 502, 503, 504]
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Reduced manual intervention
- Graceful handling of network issues

#### 4.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implemented a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when the API is experiencing issues.

```python
def _check_circuit_breaker(self):
    """Check if the circuit breaker is open (too many failures)."""
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Reset failure count if reset interval has passed
    if current_time - self.last_failure_reset > self.circuit_reset_interval:
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_reset = current_time
        self.circuit_open = False
    
    # Check if circuit is open
    if self.circuit_open:
        if current_time - self.circuit_open_time > self.circuit_open_duration:
            # Try to close the circuit after the open duration
            logging.info("Circuit breaker: Attempting to close circuit")
            self.circuit_open = False
        else:
            # Circuit is still open
            return True
    
    # Check if we should open the circuit
    if self.failure_count >= self.max_failures:
        logging.warning(f"Circuit breaker: Opening circuit after {self.failure_count} failures")
        self.circuit_open = True
        self.circuit_open_time = current_time
        return True
    
    return False
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevention of cascading failures
- Automatic service degradation during issues
- Faster recovery from systemic failures
