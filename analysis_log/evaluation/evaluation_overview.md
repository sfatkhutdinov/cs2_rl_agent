## Overview
The evaluation directory contains scripts and tools dedicated to evaluating trained reinforcement learning models. This separation from the training and testing directories helps maintain a clear distinction between model training, testing of components, and systematic evaluation of trained models.

## Components

### evaluate.py
The primary evaluation script that loads trained models and evaluates their performance against specified metrics.

#### Key Functionality
- Loading trained models from the models directory
- Creating appropriate environments for evaluation
- Running evaluation episodes and collecting performance metrics
- Generating visualizations and reports of model performance
- Comparative analysis between different model versions

#### Usage
```bash
python evaluation/evaluate.py --model-path models/your_model_path --episodes 10 --render
```

#### Key Parameters
- `--model-path`: Path to the trained model to evaluate
- `--config`: Path to the configuration file
- `--episodes`: Number of episodes to run for evaluation
- `--render`: Whether to render the environment during evaluation
- `--output-dir`: Directory to save evaluation results

## Integration with Other Components

### Relationship to Training
The evaluation system works closely with the training system by:
- Loading models produced by training scripts
- Using the same environment configurations for consistent comparison
- Providing feedback that can inform further training iterations

### Relationship to Testing
While the testing directory focuses on unit and integration tests for system components, the evaluation directory focuses on:
- End-to-end assessment of trained models
- Performance benchmarking across different scenarios
- Qualitative analysis of agent behavior

## Future Enhancements
Planned enhancements for the evaluation system include:
- Automated generation of evaluation reports
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Integration with continuous integration workflows
- Extended visualization capabilities for behavior analysis
