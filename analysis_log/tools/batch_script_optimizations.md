# Batch Script Optimization Documentation

*Last updated: March 13, 2025 20:55 - Updated with testing scripts optimization*

**Tags:** #tools #optimization #batch #documentation

## Overview

This document tracks the optimization of batch scripts in the CS2 RL Agent project. It serves as a record of changes made to improve script performance, reduce redundancy, and enhance error handling.

## Optimization Strategy

The optimization strategy focuses on these key areas:

1. **Reducing redundancy** - Creating common functions that can be reused across scripts
2. **Improving error handling** - Adding robust error detection and recovery
3. **Enhancing performance** - Configuring scripts for better resource utilization
4. **Simplifying maintenance** - Making scripts more modular and easier to update
5. **Caching results** - Preventing redundant system calls and operations

## Optimizations Performed

### March 13, 2025 20:40 - Common Functions Library

**Created `scripts/utils/common_functions.bat`**

This library contains reusable functions to standardize common operations across all batch scripts:

- `activate_conda` - Activates conda environment only if not already active
- `setup_gpu` - Sets standard GPU optimization environment variables
- `check_dependencies` - Checks and only installs dependencies if needed
- `check_ollama` - Verifies Ollama is running
- `detect_gpu` - Detects GPU capabilities with result caching
- `error_handler` - Implements retry logic for failed commands
- `cleanup_temp` - Removes temporary files
- `set_high_priority` - Sets process priority for better performance

The library is designed to be called from other batch scripts with:
```batch
call common_functions.bat
call :function_name [parameters]
```
