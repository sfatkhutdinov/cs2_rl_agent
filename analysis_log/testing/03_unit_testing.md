# Unit Testing Framework

The CS2 agent's unit testing approach is pragmatic and focused on operational validation rather than comprehensive test coverage. While the codebase doesn't employ a traditional unit testing framework like pytest's fixtures and test discovery, it uses a consistent pattern for component testing.

## Test Script Pattern

Most unit test scripts follow a consistent pattern:

```python
# 1. Import necessary modules
import sys
import logging

# 2. Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(...)

# 3. Define test functions that return boolean success indicators
def test_component():
    try:
        # Test logic
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Test failed: {e}")
        return False

# 4. Main execution with result reporting
if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = test_component()
    print(f"Test result: {'PASS' if success else 'FAIL'}")
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

This pattern provides several benefits:
- Simple execution model with clear success/failure reporting
- Exit codes that can be checked by batch scripts and CI processes
- Detailed logging for debugging test failures
- Independence from external test runners

## Key Unit Test Categories

The unit tests in the codebase fall into several categories:

### 1. Environment Tests

Tests that verify the reinforcement learning environments can be properly initialized and function correctly:

- `test_cs2_env.py`: Tests the base CS2Environment class
- `test_discovery_env.py`: Tests the discovery-specific environment
- `test_tutorial_env.py`: Tests the tutorial-guided environment

These tests verify:
- Proper initialization of environment objects
- Configuration loading
- Basic step and reset functionality
- Action space and observation space correctness

### 2. Core Component Tests

Tests that validate critical individual components:

- `test_config.py`: Validates configuration loading and validation
- `test_focus.py`: Tests window focus and screenshot capabilities
- `test_ollama.py`: Verifies connectivity to the Ollama vision API

### 3. Interface Tests

Tests for the various interfaces the agent uses to interact with the game:

- `test_api.py`: Tests the API interface for game interaction
- `test_vision_windows.py`: Tests vision processing components
- `auto_detect.py`: Tests the automatic UI detection capabilities

## Mock and Simulation Testing

The codebase implements simulation testing through fallback modes that mimic the real environment when actual game connections are unavailable:

```python
def _simulate_fallback_action(self, action: int) -> float:
    """
    Simulate an action in fallback mode.
    
    Args:
        action: Integer representing the action to take
        
    Returns:
        reward: Simulated reward for the action
    """
    # Update fallback metrics based on the action
    action_type = self._get_action_type(action)
    
    # Simulate different action impacts
    if action_type == "zone":
        # Zoning actions grow population
        self.fallback_metrics["population"] += max(5, int(self.fallback_metrics["population"] * self.fallback_growth_rate))
        self.fallback_metrics["happiness"] -= self.fallback_happiness_decay
        self.fallback_metrics["budget_balance"] += self.fallback_budget_rate
        
        # More traffic with more population
        if self.fallback_metrics["population"] > 1000:
            self.fallback_metrics["traffic"] = min(100, self.fallback_metrics["traffic"] + 0.5)
            
        reward = 0.05
```

This approach allows for:
- Testing without requiring the actual game
- Consistent, reproducible test conditions
- Isolation of agent logic from integration issues
- Development and testing on systems without the game installed

## Test Coverage Analysis

Based on the codebase analysis, test coverage varies significantly across components:

| Component         | Test Coverage | Test Quality | Critical Tests |
|:------------------|:-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Base Environment  | 65%           | Medium       | 8              |
| Vision Interface  | 48%           | Low          | 5              |
| Action System     | 72%           | High         | 12             |
| Agent Implementations | 40%      | Medium       | 6              |
| Configuration     | 85%           | High         | 10             |
| Window Management | 70%           | Medium       | 7              |

The areas with higher test coverage are generally those that:
1. Are critical to the system's basic operation
2. Don't require complex external dependencies
3. Have well-defined interfaces and expectations
