# Test Automation and CI/CD

**Tags:** #testing #automation #CI/CD #analysis

The CS2 reinforcement learning agent employs a partially automated testing approach centered around batch files rather than a formal CI/CD pipeline. This pragmatic approach emphasizes operational validation and developer-driven testing rather than fully automated continuous integration.

## Batch File Automation

The core of the test automation is a collection of batch files that orchestrate various testing activities:

```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│    Batch File Test Automation  │
└────────────────────────────────┘
             │
     ┌───────┴───────┐
     │               │
┌────▼────┐     ┌────▼────┐
│Component │     │Component│
│ Setup    │     │  Test   │
└─────────-┘     └─────────┘
     │               │
     └───────┬───────┘
             │
      ┌──────▼──────┐
      │   Result    │
      │ Verification│
      └─────────────┘
```

The key batch files involved in test automation include:

```
test_config.bat
test_cs2_env.bat
test_adaptive_modes.bat
test_discovery_env.bat
test_ollama.bat
run_vision_test.bat
```

Each batch file follows a common pattern:

```batch
@echo off
echo Running Test: [Test Name]
echo ==================================

REM Activate the conda environment
call conda activate cs2_agent || (
    echo Failed to activate conda environment.
    echo Please run setup_conda.bat first.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

REM Run the test script
python test_script.py [arguments]

REM Check the result
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo Test FAILED.
    pause
    exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%
) else (
    echo Test PASSED.
    echo ==================================
)
```

This approach offers several benefits:
- Simple execution for developers
- Environment consistency across test runs
- Clear error handling and feedback
- Integration with other batch-driven processes

## All-in-One Test Orchestration

The `all_in_one_setup_and_train.bat` script serves as a comprehensive test orchestration tool, implementing a sequential testing process:

```batch
REM ======== STEP 7: Run Tests ========
echo.
echo Step 7: Running environment tests...

echo Testing configuration...
python test_config.py config/discovery_config.yaml
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Configuration test failed. Please fix the issues before running training.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo Testing CS2Environment class...
python test_cs2_env.py
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo CS2Environment test failed. Please fix the issues before running training.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo Testing screenshot and focus capabilities...
python test_focus.py
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Screenshot and focus test failed. This may affect the agent's ability to interact with the game.
    choice /c YN /m "Continue anyway? (Y/N)"
    if errorlevel 2 exit /b 1
)
```

This orchestration provides:
- Sequential dependency testing
- Critical failure handling
- Non-critical warning handling
- User-decision points for test failures

## Missing Formal CI/CD Components

The codebase lacks several components typically found in formal CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Automated Repository Integration**: The codebase doesn't appear to include GitHub Actions or similar workflows that automatically run tests on commit/push.

2. **Automated Build Verification**: There's no automated build verification step that ensures the codebase remains in a deployable state.

3. **Deployment Automation**: Deployment steps are primarily manual rather than automated through a pipeline.

4. **Regression Test Automation**: While there are regression tests, they aren't automatically run on changes to verify continued functionality.

## Manual Testing Processes

The testing infrastructure relies heavily on manual testing processes:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Manual Testing Workflow            │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
      ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
      │              │              │
┌─────▼──────┐ ┌─────▼──────┐ ┌─────▼──────┐
│  Vision    │ │  Training  │ │  Agent     │
│ Interface  │ │ Performance│ │  Behavior  │
│  Testing   │ │  Testing   │ │   Testing  │
└────────────┘ └────────────┘ └────────────┘
```

Key manual testing processes include:
- Vision interface validation using test images
- Agent behavior observation during gameplay
- Performance monitoring during extended training runs
- Configuration validation across different environments

## Automation Challenges

The testing automation faces several challenges:

1. **Game Dependency**: Many tests require the actual game to be running, making full automation difficult.

2. **Hardware Variability**: Tests involving GPU acceleration behave differently across hardware configurations.

3. **External Service Dependency**: Tests depending on the Ollama service require external setup and management.

4. **Long-Running Tests**: Some tests (especially training-related tests) run for extended periods, making them difficult to include in automation.
