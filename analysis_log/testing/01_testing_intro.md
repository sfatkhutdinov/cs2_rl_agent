# Introduction to Testing Infrastructure

**Tags:** #testing #methodology #analysis

This document provides an overview of the testing infrastructure for the CS2 reinforcement learning agent. The testing approach is designed to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the agent across various components and scenarios.

## Testing Methodology

The CS2 reinforcement learning agent employs a partially automated testing approach centered around batch files rather than a formal CI/CD pipeline. This pragmatic approach emphasizes operational validation and developer-driven testing rather than fully automated continuous integration.

The testing methodology includes:

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components
- **Functional Testing**: Testing end-to-end functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring and validating performance metrics
- **Manual Testing**: Human-driven validation of complex behaviors

## Testing Challenges

The testing infrastructure faces several challenges unique to reinforcement learning and game interaction:

1. **External Dependencies**: Reliance on the CS2 game, Ollama service, and GPU hardware
2. **Non-Deterministic Behavior**: Randomness in training, vision processing, and performance
3. **Complex State Management**: Difficulty in creating reproducible test scenarios
4. **Long-Running Tests**: Extended duration of training and performance tests
