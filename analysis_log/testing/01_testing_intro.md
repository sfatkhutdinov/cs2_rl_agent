# Testing Infrastructure Analysis - Introduction

## Context
This analysis examines the testing infrastructure of the CS2 reinforcement learning agent. A robust testing framework is essential for ensuring the reliability, performance, and correctness of the agent's behavior. This document details the architecture, methodologies, and tools used for testing the various components of the CS2 agent, as well as identifying areas for potential improvement.

## Methodology
To analyze the testing infrastructure, we:
1. Examined the test files and frameworks across the codebase
2. Analyzed test coverage and testing strategies
3. Evaluated integration and end-to-end testing approaches
4. Assessed performance testing methodologies
5. Identified strengths and weaknesses in the current testing approach
