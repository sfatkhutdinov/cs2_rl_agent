# Challenges and Limitations

The CS2 reinforcement learning agent's testing infrastructure faces several significant challenges and limitations that impact its effectiveness and comprehensiveness.

## External Dependencies

The testing infrastructure is heavily dependent on external components:

1. **Game Dependency**: Many tests require access to the CS2 game, which:
   - Cannot be easily integrated into automated testing
   - May have different behavior across versions
   - Requires specific system requirements

2. **Ollama Service Dependency**: Tests involving the vision interface require:
   - Running Ollama service with specific models
   - Sufficient GPU resources for model inference
   - Network connectivity for API requests

3. **GPU Hardware Dependency**: Performance tests require:
   - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
   - Specific driver versions
   - Sufficient VRAM for model operations

## Testing Environment Consistency

Maintaining consistent testing environments is challenging:

```python
# Environment setup for testing often requires complex initialization
def setup_test_environment():
    """Set up the testing environment."""
    # Check for game installation
    if not is_game_installed():
        raise TestEnvironmentError("Game not installed")
    
    # Check for Ollama service
    if not is_ollama_running():
        raise TestEnvironmentError("Ollama service not running")
    
    # Check for required model
    if not is_model_available("llama3.2-vision"):
        raise TestEnvironmentError("Required vision model not available")
    
    # Check GPU availability
    if not is_gpu_available():
        raise TestEnvironmentError("GPU not available or not configured properly")
    
    # Initialize test directories
    initialize_test_directories()
```

These consistency challenges lead to:
- Intermittent test failures
- Environment-specific bugs
- Difficulty reproducing reported issues

## Non-Deterministic Behavior

The reinforcement learning agent exhibits non-deterministic behavior that complicates testing:

1. **Training Randomness**: The training process involves inherent randomness:
   - Random initialization of neural networks
   - Stochastic action selection during exploration
   - Environment randomness during training

2. **Vision Processing Variability**: The vision system introduces variability:
   - OCR confidence fluctuations
   - Visual element detection variations
   - Screen resolution and scaling differences

3. **Performance Timing Variations**: Performance measurements can vary:
   - System load fluctuations
   - Background process interference
   - Cache behavior differences

## Test Isolation Challenges

Achieving proper test isolation is difficult:

```python
# Tests may have interdependencies that are difficult to isolate
def test_adaptive_agent():
    """Test the adaptive agent."""
    # This test relies on:
    # 1. Working environment
    # 2. Functioning base agent
    # 3. Properly configured mode switching
    # 4. Valid reward calculation
    
    agent = AdaptiveAgent(config)
    success = run_test_scenario(agent)
    
    return success
```

These isolation challenges result in:
- Cascading test failures
- Unclear failure root causes
- Difficulty fixing specific components

## Manual Verification Requirements

Many tests require manual verification:

1. **Visual Element Verification**: Confirming that UI elements are correctly detected often requires visual inspection.

2. **Game Interaction Verification**: Verifying that the agent correctly interacts with the game requires observing its behavior.

3. **Strategic Decision Verification**: Assessing the quality of strategic decisions requires domain expertise and game understanding.

## Limited Coverage Metrics

The testing infrastructure lacks comprehensive coverage metrics:

1. **Line Coverage**: There's no systematic tracking of which lines of code are executed by tests.

2. **Branch Coverage**: Branch and decision coverage is not measured.

3. **Path Coverage**: Path coverage through complex logic is not assessed.

4. **Feature Coverage**: There's limited tracking of which features are covered by tests.

## Testing Performance Overhead

Some tests introduce significant performance overhead:

```python
# Performance testing can be extremely time-consuming
def test_extended_training():
    """Test extended training stability."""
    # This test runs for many episodes
    env = CS2Environment(config)
    agent = PPOAgent(config)
    
    total_episodes = 100  # Can take hours to complete
    
    for episode in range(total_episodes):
        observation, info = env.reset()
        done = False
        
        while not done:
            action = agent.select_action(observation)
            next_observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
            
            agent.store_transition(observation, action, reward, next_observation, terminated)
            
            done = terminated or truncated
            observation = next_observation
        
        # Update agent
        agent.update()
    
    # Evaluate final performance
    return evaluate_agent(agent, env)
```

This performance overhead leads to:
- Long test execution times
- Limited comprehensive testing in development cycles
- Selective test execution rather than full test runs
