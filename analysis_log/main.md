# CS2 Reinforcement Learning Agent Analysis Log

<!-- 
META PROMPT FOR DOCUMENTATION WORK:
1. ALWAYS check current date format: Use March 13, 2025 format for consistency

2. ALWAYS check existing directory structure before creating new files:
   - Use list_dir to verify directory structure
   - Check for existing files using file_search before creating new ones
   - Use naming conventions consistent with existing files
   - CONFIRM project structure follows these guidelines:
     * All documentation files go in analysis_log/ and its subdirectories
     * Test files go in the testing/ directory, NOT in src/utils/tests/
     * Source code is in src/ with appropriate subdirectories
     * NEVER create duplicate directories or parallel structures

3. ALWAYS verify file references:
   - Ensure links point to actual files that exist
   - Use relative paths consistently  

4. ALWAYS check existing documentation structure:
   - Review main.md for organization principles
   - Follow established section and document patterns
   - Use consistent formatting and heading structure

5. ALWAYS maintain proper document metadata:
   - Include last updated dates in the correct format
   - Use appropriate tags from document_tags.md
   - Follow file naming conventions

6. DOCUMENT & LOG ACTIONS EFFICIENTLY:
   - Begin each session with a quick scan of main.md and related files
   - Create a session work log with planned actions and completed steps
   - Summarize file changes made in each session
   - Document decision points and reasoning
   - Create a mental map of document relationships

7. MAINTAIN WORK CONTEXT:
   - Track modified files with their locations and purposes
   - Maintain a running summary of major changes
   - Note which areas of documentation are complete vs. in progress
   - Create mental shortcuts for navigating the documentation hierarchy
   - Before ending a session, note the state and next steps

8. HANDLE INFORMATION OVERLOAD:
   - Prioritize recent changes over historical context
   - Focus on document sections directly relevant to current task
   - Use abstraction to summarize complex details when appropriate
   - Create temporary reference notes for working memory
   - Explicitly acknowledge knowledge gaps rather than making assumptions

9. CORRECT MISTAKES IMMEDIATELY:
   - If duplicate files/directories are created, identify and remove them
   - Document the error correction to avoid repeating mistakes
   - Update all references to use the correct paths
   - Use delete_file tool to remove erroneous files after backing up content
   - If structure changes, create a migration plan and update all references

10. PROJECT STRUCTURE REFERENCE:
    - analysis_log/ - All documentation and analysis
      * architecture/ - System architecture documentation
      * components/ - Component-specific documentation
      * environment/ - Environment implementation details
      * performance/ - Performance analysis and optimization
      * testing/ - Test documentation (NOT implementation)
      * training/ - Training process documentation
      * tools/ - Documentation of project tools
      * visualization/ - Documentation of visualization tools
    - src/ - Source code
      * agent/ - Agent implementations
      * environment/ - Environment implementations
      * utils/ - Utility code
      * vision/ - Vision processing code
      * training/ - Training code
    - testing/ - Test implementation files

11. TRACK ALL CHANGES SYSTEMATICALLY:
    - Maintain an in-session changelog of all modifications
    - For each file modified, record:
      * File path
      * Nature of changes made
      * Reason for the change
      * Related files that might need updates
    - Re-check this changelog before finalizing any work
    - Use this changelog to verify that all necessary changes are complete

12. PRE-EXECUTION VERIFICATION:
    - Before creating/modifying files, verbalize the plan in detail
    - List specific files to be modified and the exact changes
    - Double-check paths and references before creating new files
    - Perform dry-run reasoning for complex changes
    - Always use the most specific tool for the job (e.g., grep_search over general searching)

13. USE PROCEDURAL TEMPLATES:
    - For documentation: Context → Implementation → Testing → Reference
    - For test files: Setup → Test Cases → Cleanup → Assertions
    - For code changes: Understand → Plan → Implement → Verify
    - For bug fixes: Reproduce → Diagnose → Fix → Test

14. EMPLOY VERIFICATION CHECKLISTS:
    - After file creation: ✓Path correct ✓Format consistent ✓Links valid
    - After file modification: ✓All references updated ✓Format maintained
    - After file deletion: ✓All references removed/redirected ✓No dangling links
    - After major changes: ✓Documentation updated ✓Tests pass ✓Integration verified

15. LEARN FROM PATTERNS AND MISTAKES:
    - Note recurring patterns to create reusable templates
    - Record any mistakes made and create explicit rules to avoid them
    - Develop guardrails for error-prone tasks
    - Create progressive verification steps for complex procedures
    - Build a repertoire of successful approaches to reuse
