# CS2 Reinforcement Learning Agent Analysis Log

<!-- 
META PROMPT FOR DOCUMENTATION WORK:
1. ALWAYS check current date format: 
   - Use the ACTUAL CURRENT DATE in format: Month Day, Year HH:MM (e.g., March 13, 2025 16:36)
   - NEVER use example dates like the ones shown above
   - Use run_terminal_cmd to get the current date if needed (e.g., `date` or `Get-Date`)
   - For Windows: run_terminal_cmd with `Get-Date -Format "MMMM d, yyyy HH:mm"`
   - For Unix/Linux: run_terminal_cmd with `date "+%B %d, %Y %H:%M"`

2. ALWAYS check existing directory structure before creating new files:
   - Use list_dir to verify directory structure
   - Check for existing files using file_search before creating new ones
   - Use naming conventions consistent with existing files
   - CONFIRM project structure follows these guidelines:
     * All documentation files go in analysis_log/ and its subdirectories
     * Test files go in the testing/ directory, NOT in src/utils/tests/
     * Source code is in src/ with appropriate subdirectories
     * NEVER create duplicate directories or parallel structures

3. ALWAYS verify file references:
   - Ensure links point to actual files that exist
   - Use relative paths consistently  

4. ALWAYS check existing documentation structure:
   - Review main.md for organization principles
   - Follow established section and document patterns
   - Use consistent formatting and heading structure

5. ALWAYS maintain proper document metadata:
   - Include last updated dates in the correct format (Month Day, Year HH:MM)
   - ALWAYS get the ACTUAL CURRENT DATE using run_terminal_cmd when updating dates
   - IMMEDIATELY update the last updated date whenever ANY changes are made to a file
   - Document the nature of the update in the date line (e.g., "Last updated: <ACTUAL_CURRENT_DATE> - Added performance analysis section")
   - Use appropriate tags from document_tags.md
   - Follow file naming conventions
   - Verify the "Last updated" date appears at the top of each document, directly after frontmatter if present

6. DOCUMENT & LOG ACTIONS EFFICIENTLY:
   - Begin each session with a quick scan of main.md and related files
   - Create a session work log with planned actions and completed steps
   - Summarize file changes made in each session
   - Document decision points and reasoning
   - Create documentation relationship maps as actual reference files

7. MAINTAIN WORK CONTEXT:
   - Track modified files with their locations and purposes
   - Maintain a running summary of major changes
   - Note which areas of documentation are complete vs. in progress
   - Create a session-specific document relationship index for complex tasks
   - Before ending a session, create a "next steps" section with specific files and actions

8. HANDLE INFORMATION OVERLOAD:
   - Prioritize recent changes over historical context
   - Focus on document sections directly relevant to current task
   - Use abstraction to summarize complex details when appropriate
   - Create temporary reference notes for working memory
   - Explicitly acknowledge knowledge gaps rather than making assumptions

9. CORRECT MISTAKES IMMEDIATELY:
   - If duplicate files/directories are created, identify and remove them
   - Document the error correction to avoid repeating mistakes
   - Update all references to use the correct paths
   - Use delete_file tool to remove erroneous files after backing up content
   - If structure changes, create a migration plan and update all references

10. PROJECT STRUCTURE REFERENCE:

11. TRACK ALL CHANGES SYSTEMATICALLY:
    - Maintain an in-session changelog of all modifications
    - For each file modified, record:
      * File path
      * Nature of changes made
      * Reason for the change
      * Related files that might need updates
    - Re-check this changelog before finalizing any work
    - Use this changelog to verify that all necessary changes are complete

12. PRE-EXECUTION VERIFICATION:
    - Before creating/modifying files, verbalize the plan in detail
    - List specific files to be modified and the exact changes
    - Double-check paths and references before creating new files
    - Perform dry-run reasoning for complex changes
    - Always use the most specific tool for the job (e.g., grep_search over general searching)

    - Develop guardrails for error-prone tasks
    - Create progressive verification steps for complex procedures
    - Build a repertoire of successful approaches to reuse

16. CREATE EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION MAPS:
    - For complex document networks, create an actual .md file as a map
    - Use formats like:
      * document_map.md - Overview of document relationships
      * topic_index.md - Index of all documents on a specific topic
      * changes_log.md - Running log of significant changes across sessions
    - Include graphical representations when helpful (ASCII diagrams or links to images)
    - Update these maps when adding new documents or significant sections
    - Reference these maps in related documentation

      ```

20. IMPLEMENT TIME-SEPARATED VERIFICATION:
    - Create artificial separation between creation and verification
    - After implementing a change, switch to a different task briefly
    - Return with fresh perspective to verify the work
    - Apply verification checklists without referring to original implementation logic

    - Maintain an error pattern registry documenting:
      * Common error types encountered
      * Warning signs that preceded errors
      * Mitigation strategies for each error type
    - Before finalizing work, check against known error patterns
    - After discovering errors, update the registry with new patterns
    - Apply pattern-specific verification for high-risk changes
    - Document using this format:
      ```
      ### ‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR PATTERN CHECK

      - Verification strategy: [How we'll handle these uncertainties]
      ```

25. SYNCHRONIZE IMPLEMENTATION AND DOCUMENTATION:
    - Use bi-directional tracing between code and documentation

      2. `git diff [modified-file]` to review changes
      3. `git add [modified-file]` to stage changes
      4. `git commit -m "descriptive message"` to commit changes
    - Use git commands for robust version control of all changes
    - For each significant change or logical group of changes:
      * Create atomic commits with descriptive messages
      * Reference related issues/tickets in commit messages
      * Use consistent commit message format
    - Periodically check git history to understand evolution
    - Use git diff to verify changes before finalizing
    - Document git operations in this format:
      ```
      ### üì¶ GIT OPERATIONS
      - Staged changes:
        * [File 1]: [Description of changes]

      * `git checkout -b [branch-name]` - Create new branch if needed
      
27. ENFORCE MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCEDURES:
    - VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR EVERY RESPONSE:
      * ‚úì ACTUAL CURRENT DATE was obtained via terminal command
      * ‚úì "Last updated" date was updated with ACTUAL date
      * ‚úì Git operations were performed after file changes
      * ‚úì Changes were committed with descriptive message
    - Add the following to EVERY response after making file changes:
