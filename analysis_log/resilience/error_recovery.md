# Error Recovery Mechanisms and Production Resilience Analysis

## Context
This document details how the CS2 reinforcement learning agent handles failures in production environments, building on previous investigations into error handling code in the CS2 environment and vision interfaces.

## Methodology
1. Examined error handling code in the CS2 environment class
2. Analyzed the Ollama vision interface error handling and retry logic
3. Studied the fallback mode implementation for critical failures
4. Analyzed retry mechanisms for transient failures
5. Investigated recovery procedures from various failure modes

## Error Recovery Architecture

### Layered Defense Strategy
The system implements a comprehensive layered approach to error handling:

1. **Prevention**: Configuration validation and pre-flight tests to prevent errors
2. **Detection**: Extensive logging and monitoring to quickly identify failures
3. **Containment**: Exception handling to prevent cascading failures
4. **Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and state restoration
5. **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to simulated environment when components fail

### Fallback Mode Implementation
The CS2 environment implements a sophisticated fallback mode that activates when critical components fail:

```python
def _setup_fallback_mode(self):
    """Set up fallback mode for the environment."""
    self.logger.info("Setting up fallback mode...")
    
    # Configure fallback mode based on settings
    if self.fallback_mode_enabled:
        self.logger.warning("Fallback mode is ENABLED")
        # Initialize fallback components
        self._initialize_fallback_components()
    else:
        self.logger.info("Fallback mode is disabled")
```

When triggered, fallback mode:
- Switches to a simulated environment interface
- Uses cached observations when possible
- Simulates actions rather than executing them
- Maintains basic functionality for training to continue

### API Failure Recovery
The Ollama vision interface implements sophisticated retry logic for handling API failures:

```python
def _get_response_with_retry(self, image_data, prompt):
    """Send a request to the Ollama API with retry logic."""
    max_retries = self.max_retries
    retry_count = 0
    
    while retry_count <= max_retries:
        try:
            # Log attempt information
            self.logger.debug(f"API query attempt {retry_count+1}/{max_retries+1}")
            start_time = time.time()
            
            # Make the actual API call
            response = self._make_api_call(image_data, prompt)
            
            # Calculate and log response time
            response_time = time.time() - start_time
            self.logger.debug(f"Response received in {response_time:.2f}s")
            
            # Process successful response
            if response.status_code == 200:
                try:
                    result = response.json()
                    return result, None
                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                    self.logger.error(f"Failed to decode JSON response: {e}")
                    return None, str(e)
            
            # Handle different error status codes
            elif response.status_code == 400:
                self.logger.warning(f"Bad request (400): Possible issue with prompt or image")
                return None, f"Bad request: {response.text}"
            
            elif response.status_code in [429, 503]:
                # Rate limiting or service unavailable - should retry
                retry_count += 1
                if retry_count <= max_retries:
                    retry_delay = self._calculate_backoff(retry_count)
                    self.logger.warning(f"Rate limited or service unavailable ({response.status_code}). Retrying in {retry_delay:.2f}s")
                    time.sleep(retry_delay)
                else:
                    self.logger.error(f"Max retries exceeded for rate limiting")
                    return None, f"Rate limiting error: {response.text}"
            
            elif response.status_code >= 500:
                # Server error - should retry
                retry_count += 1
                if retry_count <= max_retries:
                    retry_delay = self._calculate_backoff(retry_count)
                    self.logger.warning(f"Server error ({response.status_code}). Retrying in {retry_delay:.2f}s")
                    time.sleep(retry_delay)
                else:
                    self.logger.error(f"Max retries exceeded for server error")
                    return None, f"Server error: {response.text}"
            
            else:
                # Other errors - may not be retryable
                self.logger.error(f"Unexpected status code: {response.status_code}")
                return None, f"Unexpected error: {response.text}"
        
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            retry_count += 1
            if retry_count <= max_retries:
                retry_delay = self._calculate_backoff(retry_count)
                self.logger.warning(f"Request timed out. Retrying in {retry_delay:.2f}s")
                time.sleep(retry_delay)
            else:
                self.logger.error("Max retries exceeded for timeout")
                return None, "Timeout after multiple retries"
        
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
            retry_count += 1
            if retry_count <= max_retries:
                retry_delay = self._calculate_backoff(retry_count)
                self.logger.warning(f"Connection error: {e}. Retrying in {retry_delay:.2f}s")
                time.sleep(retry_delay)
            else:
                self.logger.error(f"Max retries exceeded for connection error: {e}")
                return None, f"Connection error: {str(e)}"
        
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Unexpected error during API call: {e}")
            return None, str(e)
    
    return None, "Max retries exceeded"

def _calculate_backoff(self, retry_count):
    """Calculate exponential backoff with jitter."""
    base_delay = self.base_delay
    max_delay = self.max_delay
    
    # Exponential backoff
    delay = min(max_delay, base_delay * (2 ** (retry_count - 1)))
    
    # Add jitter (Â±25%)
    jitter = random.uniform(-0.25, 0.25) * delay
    delay += jitter
    
    self.logger.debug(f"Calculated retry delay: {delay:.2f}s (retry {retry_count})")
    return delay
```

This implementation includes:
- Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent the "thundering herd" problem
- Differentiated handling for various error types
- Detailed logging of retry attempts
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### Window Focus Recovery
The system includes a `FocusHelper` class that maintains game window focus and can recover when focus is lost:

```python
class FocusHelper:
    def __init__(self, window_name):
        self.window_name = window_name
        self.hwnd = None
        self.focus_methods = [
            self._focus_method_default,
            self._focus_method_alternate,
            self._focus_method_last_resort
        ]
        
    def ensure_window_focus(self):
        """Ensure the game window has focus, trying multiple methods if needed."""
        if self.hwnd is None:
            self._find_window()
            
        # Try each focus method until one succeeds
        for method in self.focus_methods:
            if method():
                return True
                
        return False
```

The focus recovery system implements multiple fallback methods, attempting each one until focus is regained.

## Production Resilience Mechanisms

### Checkpoint Management
The system regularly saves model checkpoints and implements proper recovery:
- Saves checkpoints at configurable intervals
- Maintains best model checkpoints separately
- Can resume training from any checkpoint
- Validates checkpoint integrity before loading

### Self-Healing Capabilities
The agent implements several self-healing mechanisms:
- Automatic reconnection to game when connection is lost
- Service health monitoring with restart capability
- Agent state preservation across restarts
- Progressive timeout escalation for unresponsive services

### Graceful Degradation
When components fail, the system gracefully degrades:
- Falls back to template matching when ML vision fails
- Continues core learning even with degraded capabilities
- Prioritizes critical operations during resource constraints
- Maintains observation consistency during partial failures

### Configuration Robustness
Configuration loading includes multiple fallback paths:
- Attempts to load from specified path
- Falls back to default paths if primary fails
- Provides clear error messages for configuration issues
- Validates configuration before applying

## Error Scenarios and Recovery Strategies

### Game Crash Recovery
When the game crashes, the system:
1. Detects the crash through window handle checking
2. Logs the crash event and reason (if available)
3. Attempts to restart the game via subprocess
4. Restores previous game state if possible
5. Continues training with minimal interruption

### Vision API Failure Recovery
When the vision API fails, the system:
1. Attempts retries with exponential backoff
2. Falls back to cached responses if available
3. Switches to alternate vision methods (e.g., template matching)
4. Logs detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting
5. Continues training with degraded vision capabilities

### Action Execution Failure Recovery
When action execution fails, the system:
1. Detects the failure through response validation
2. Attempts to repeat the action with modified parameters
3. Falls back to simpler action alternatives if available
4. Updates internal state to reflect the failure
5. Logs the failure for debugging and analysis

### Observation Extraction Failure Recovery
When observation extraction fails, the system:
1. Attempts multiple extraction methods
2. Uses previous valid observations if current extraction fails
3. Extrapolates missing values from historical data
4. Applies data validation to ensure observation consistency
5. Adds uncertainty markers to affected observation components
