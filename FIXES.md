# Fixes for the DiscoveryEnvironment Import Error

## Issues

### Issue 1: Class Import Error

The training script was failing with the error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'DiscoveryEnvironment' from 'src.environment.discovery_env'
```

### Issue 2: Missing Configuration Keys

After fixing the first issue, the script failed with another error:
```
KeyError: 'paths'
```

### Issue 3: Missing 'include_visual' Key

After fixing Issue 2, the script failed with a new error:
```
KeyError: 'include_visual'
```

## Root Causes

### Root Cause for Issue 1

There was a naming mismatch between the class implementation and the imports:

1. The class in `src/environment/discovery_env.py` was named `DiscoveryCS2Environment`
2. The import in `src/environment/__init__.py` was trying to import `DiscoveryEnvironment`
3. The configuration in `config/discovery_config.yaml` was referencing `DiscoveryEnvironment`

### Root Cause for Issue 2

The Logger class required a 'paths' section in the configuration file, but it was missing. Additionally, the training configuration was missing some required keys like 'save_freq'.

### Root Cause for Issue 3

The configuration structure had a mismatch between what the base CS2Environment expected and what was being passed. Specifically:

1. CS2Environment was looking for `config["environment"]["observation_space"]["include_visual"]`
2. But our configuration had this key at `config["observation"]["include_visual"]`
3. The configuration wasn't being properly structured when passed between environment classes

## Fixes Applied

### Fixes for Issue 1

1. **Class Name Correction** - Changed the class name in discovery_env.py from `DiscoveryCS2Environment` to `DiscoveryEnvironment` to match imports and configuration.

2. **Script Updates** - Updated `train_discovery.py` to use the correct class name.

3. **Test Utilities** - Created:
   - `test_discovery_env.py` - A script to test the import and instantiation
   - `test_discovery_env.bat` - A batch file to run the test

### Fixes for Issue 2

1. **Configuration Updates** - Added the required sections to the configuration file:
   - Added a 'paths' section with paths for models, logs, data, and debug files
   - Added missing training parameters like 'save_freq', 'eval_freq', and 'log_interval'

2. **Configuration Testing** - Created:
   - `test_config.py` - A script to validate the configuration and test logger initialization
   - `test_config.bat` - A batch file to run the configuration test
   - `run_discovery_fixed.bat` - An updated script that tests the configuration before running training

3. **Dependency Fix** - Commented out the system package `tesseract-ocr` in requirements.txt, which was causing installation errors.

### Fixes for Issue 3

1. **Environment Configuration Updates** - Updated the DiscoveryEnvironment initialization in train_discovery.py:
   - Explicitly copied configuration sections to prevent modification of the original config
   - Added the 'include_visual' key to both base_env_config and observation_config
   - Ensured the observation_space structure was properly set up

2. **CS2Environment Robustness** - Made CS2Environment's _setup_observation_space method more robust:
   - Added fallbacks to find the observation configuration in different parts of the config
   - Added defaults for missing configuration values
   - Used .get() with defaults instead of direct key access to avoid KeyErrors

3. **New Batch File** - Created `run_discovery_fixed2.bat` with all the latest fixes.

## Running the Fixed Code

Choose one of the following options:

1. **Run the configuration test** to verify the config file is properly set up:
   ```
   test_config.bat
   ```

2. **Run the class import test** to verify the environment imports correctly:
   ```
   test_discovery_env.bat
   ```

3. **Run the updated discovery trainer with all fixes**:
   ```
   run_discovery_fixed2.bat
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter further issues:

1. Check the log output for specific error messages
2. Run the test scripts to verify configuration and class imports are working
3. Make sure all Python packages are installed properly 
4. Verify that the Ollama server is running
5. Ensure Cities: Skylines 2 is running and visible on screen
