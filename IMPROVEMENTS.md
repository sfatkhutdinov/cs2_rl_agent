# Improvements Made to the CS2 RL Agent

## 1. Fixed Configuration Issues

- Added the missing `include_visual` key in the observation configuration which was causing the `KeyError: 'include_visual'` error.
- Created proper directory structure checks to ensure all required modules are available.
- Improved imports in the training script to correctly reference modules from the src package.

## 2. Window Management

- Created a new `window_utils.py` module with functions to:
  - Find game windows by title
  - Focus on the game window automatically
  - Refocus if the window loses focus
  - Check if the game window is currently in focus

- Added automatic window focusing at environment initialization and periodically during training to ensure the agent can properly interact with the game.

## 3. Ollama Integration Fixes

- Fixed JSON formatting in batch files for Windows compatibility, ensuring proper communication with the Ollama API.
- Created an improved setup script that properly checks for and installs the Granite 3.2 Vision model.
- Added error handling for Ollama API calls and proper model initialization.

## 4. Discovery Environment Enhancements

- Improved the discovery environment to better handle errors and missing configuration keys.
- Added better JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms for vision model responses.
- Enhanced the discovery of UI elements with more robust detection of tutorial screens and welcome buttons.
- Added logging for better debugging of the discovery process.

## 5. Development Tools

- Created `check_directories.py` to automatically set up the required directory structure.
- Added `train_discovery_with_focus.bat` for simplified training with automatic window management.
- Created a comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions.

## 6. Dependencies

- Added required dependencies like `pywin32` for window management.
- Updated the requirements.txt file with the correct versions of packages.

## Future Improvements

1. **Extended Tutorial Detection**: Further improve detection of tutorial elements and interaction with them.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce CPU/GPU usage of the vision model integration.
3. **Logging Visualization**: Add tools to visualize the training progress and discovered UI elements.
4. **Error Recovery**: Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms for when the agent gets stuck.
5. **User Interface**: Create a simple UI for controlling the training process and viewing results.
