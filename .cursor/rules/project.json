  "patterns": ["**/*"],
  "rule": "This is a reinforcement learning agent for Counter-Strike 2 with the following key characteristics:\n\n1. The project uses a multi-mode training approach with different specialized environments\n\n2. Main components include:\n   - Adaptive Agent: Meta-controller that switches between different training modes\n   - Strategic Agent: Advanced decision-making with causal modeling\n   - Environment implementations for different training scenarios\n   - Vision system for game state understanding\n   - Action system for in-game interaction\n\n3. The codebase is organized into:\n   - src/: Core implementation\n   - analysis_log/: Documentation and analysis\n   - config/: Configuration files\n   - *.bat files: Windows execution scripts\n   - *.py files in root: Main training and testing scripts\n\n4. When making code changes, maintain comprehensive documentation in the analysis_log/ directory\n\n5. Follow established code organization patterns and naming conventions\n\n6. Maintain compatibility between related files (Python scripts, batch files, configuration files)\n\n7. When working with context-sensitive documents, read file patterns from the .cursor/rules directory"
