**Tags:** #meta #documentation #guidelines #process

## Current Work
*Current documentation tasks in progress:*
- Initial setup of project documentation structure ✓
- Creation of cursor_project_rules.md ✓
- Integration of last updated notes in key documents ✓
- Removal of separate maintenance log in favor of in-document version notes ✓
- Created training directory and initial training script analyses ✓
- Updated document_tags.md with new tags for training documentation ✓
- Reorganized project directory structure for better organization ✓
  - Created logical directory structure (scripts/, training/, testing/, utils/, docs/, images/)
  - Moved files to appropriate directories
  - Updated file references in batch scripts
  - Updated README.md with new directory structure
- Verified existing documentation to avoid duplication ✓
  - Checked analysis_log/original_codebase_analysis_log.md for existing analyses
  - Reviewed training_scripts_overview.md for coverage of training approaches
  - Identified gaps in documentation that still need to be addressed

*Upcoming documentation tasks:*
1. Training Scripts Analysis
   - Analyze train_adaptive.py and document the adaptive training approach ✓
   - Analyze train_strategic.py and document the strategic agent training ✓
   - Create a comparative overview of different training approaches ✓
   - Create detailed analysis of train_discovery.py (building on existing overview)
   - Create detailed analysis of train_autonomous.py (building on existing overview)

2. Agent Implementations Analysis
   - Document the adaptive_agent.py implementation in depth ✓ (exists in components/adaptive_agent.md)
   - Document the strategic_agent.py implementation ✓ (exists in components/strategic_agent.md)
   - Document the discovery_agent.py implementation (referenced in original log but needs dedicated analysis)
   - Analyze agent mode-switching mechanisms (partially covered in adaptive_agent.md)

3. Environment and Configuration Analysis
   - Document the DiscoveryEnvironment implementation (partially covered in original log)
   - Document the AutonomousEnvironment implementation
   - Document the VisionGuidedEnvironment implementation
   - Analyze the configuration system and settings

4. Batch Scripts Organization
   - Categorize and document the various .bat scripts and their purposes ✓
   - Create a batch scripts reference document

5. Testing Scripts Analysis
   - Document the test scripts not yet covered in testing documentation
   - Link test scripts to the existing testing documentation
